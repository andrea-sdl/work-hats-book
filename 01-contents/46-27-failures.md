The NYT best seller book "4hr workweek" was rejected 27 times.

When we hear things like this we don't pay enough attention, so as an example I'll ask you to force you to read this whole page.
I know it'll get boring and tedious. But please, stay with me until the end, ok?

What does it really mean that he got rejected 27 times?
It means he sent his book to publisher and might have got some responses along these lines (please, read them all. Imaging being rejected _all of these times_)

How would he know what the 28th time would have been the right one?
He couldn't foresee it, yet he continued, trusting his work.

Think about it when you feel like giving up, because you don't know when you'll get to your 28th time, the one you reach your goal, the one when you succeed.
