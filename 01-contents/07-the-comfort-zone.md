There was this online course for wantepreneurs that tried to teach you how to get out of the comfort zone.

To do that, one exercise was to go into a bar, ask for something that was relatively cheap (a small drink, whatever) and then ask for a discount.

We don't usually do this, right? And it's extremely unsettling, but whatever the outcome you'll find that, if you do it, nothing bad happens.

It's not that they will kill you (unless you live in a really bad neighbourhood) and even if they refuse to give you the discount, everything is ok.

This is the key takeaway from stepping out of your comfort zone: Nothing bad really happens. There is no downside, there is no catastrophe, no disaster. Life continues as it should.
