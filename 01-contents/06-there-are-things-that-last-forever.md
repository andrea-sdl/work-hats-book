# there are things that last forever

One man once told me: _"Nothing is more definitive than a temporary fix."_

He was damn right.
Our internal narrative says "We'll cope with this temporary solution and then we'll fix it".
But the what eventually happens is that we will never get around to it.

I've _never_ saw a different story. The times when we decide to change a "temporary" solution are so rare that this old saying rings true.
What to do about it? Don't fool yourself and call it temporary, and go for the good solution right away.
Because, another great man said, you spend the same amount of time developing a bad and a good solution, so better go with the good one.
