# there are things that last forever

One man once told me: _"Nothing is more definitive than a temporary fix."_

He was damn right.
We tell ourselves that we will have to cope with that fix just for a little while, but soon we will find a good permanent solution.
But we will never get around to it.

I've _never_ saw a different story. The times when we decide to change a "temporary" solution are so rare that this old saying rings true.
What to do about it? Don't fool yourself and call it temporary, and go for the good solution right away.
Because, another great man said, you spend the same amount of time developing a bad and a good solution, so better go with the good one.
