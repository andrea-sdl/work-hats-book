# Preface: Why even bother?

Many popular non-fiction books have a specific skeleton to them which usually goes around three main sections: Who am I, My struggles, How I fixed it.

There's a reason for that. 
As readers we want to know who's talking, their struggles will allow us to relate with their stories and find how it connect to ours and eventually we get to the interesting part of "How they fixed their problems".

So let's be honest: I'm a normal person. Not a millionaire, nor a self-made man.
I am a Web Developer and an Entepreneur, but more importantly I'm one that failed, _a lot_.

I started years ago working as a software developer with a whole bunch of character issues, I wasn't good at communicating with people and I sucked in being calm.
Lucky me, I had one trick up my sleeve: I was determined and didn't give up.

I did my best to improve, to change what wasn't good.
I read tons of books, listened to audiobooks and podcast. Went into the self-help world, tried everything with the word "success" in it, wrote a book about self-help, got out of the self-help world and eventually found my way around many of the things I faced, from issues at work, issues with people, issues with myself.

Why even bother writing a book?
If you are a person that can read, that doesn't surrender, that can handle lots of trial and error you probably don't need this, you simply need a good book list (which you'll find at the end of the book, by the way).
But what I noticed is that we are lazy.

We tend to favor (sadly) short and fast readings with instant solutions.
So I wanted to collect some of them in a short book.
Whatever the work you do, I'm sure some of the topics I cover will be new to you as they were to me, but I felt that putting them all together would make a great recipe to help people in the small hard choices we all face in life.

As such, this book is opensource.

## How to read this book

This book is written in short chapters. 
There is no real order, so feel free to skip forward and go back as much as you want.

You will notice that subjects have fuzzy boundaries and some of the topics belong to multiple areas.
As such, read it as you please, by opening at random, skipping pages, whatever you like.
Just like life, this book has no specific rules.

## What are Work Hats?

When I started working there was this saying about the company that when we switched context we would have a different "Work Hat" on our head.

Some time you'd do the developer, other answering a call for a different client.
To do a good job you needed to be able to have many efficient work hats.

But what I later find out is that working is simply a really small part of the equation. What makes work complex and difficult is a totally different thing.
