# Conclusions

> _When nothing will work, Work will work._ Military quote.

When you tell people that you want to write a book some of them will see it as a gigantic work, impossible to achieve.
To be honest: It's hard.

But there's one rule that always followed: discipline trumps everything.
It might take time, but give it discipline and determination and you'll always get to the finish line.

I remember when I started taking singing lesson. I never sung in my entire life and wanted to try it.
I was terrible. When today I listen to my first recordings it's a torture.

Years later, though, I remember people coming to me and telling me "wow, your good". I still wasn't great, but the difference was clear.
To get there I passed along many many moments when I was awful. When my singing was low, with wrong timing, etc etc etc.

I kept practicing and in the end I become good at it.

I did the same for many things in life and this is simply to prove that I'm not special, I'm not lucky nor I have any special talent.

The recipe is the same: discipline trumps everything.
That's what you should always keep in mind. 
Whatever the goal, whatever the problems, whatever the obstacles: Discipline can get you through.

Be well and have a great life.
