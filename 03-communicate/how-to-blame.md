## how to blame

Don't blame. End of the story.

Nobody likes being blamed upon. If you really want to get an insight of why a person did something wrong ask questions.
_Why you did that? What was your reasoning? What did you expect?_

_Did you considered that X might happen?_

This will lead you to understand him/her and his/her position will be much more open than in case you started blaming.
