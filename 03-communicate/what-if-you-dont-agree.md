## what if you don't agree?

There might be times when you don't agree, maybe it's a decision that will backfire, or maybe you feel like you're risking the face of the company.

Whatever the reason is fine if you disagree. But is it fine to _always_ do it?

It all boils down to choosing the battles you really care about.
In a growing company everything is a work in progress, which means that everything can be improved.

Should everything improved right away? Probably not.
Some topics are more important and urgent than others, while other topics can be left out for a while.

If you always disagree or you're always the one giving advice there are consequences. Your words will be valued less because they're so frequent, while if you choose wisely the topics to discuss you'll have higher chances to explain your views.

Pick your battles, because you wouldn't have the energy to fight them all anyway.
