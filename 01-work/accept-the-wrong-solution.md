## accept the wrong solution

It happens. You work so much but you seems stuck into a maze. No solution on the horizon to be found.

What to do then? You could continue searching for it, but there's a fine line between success and failure, between understanding when's the right time to quit.

That decision is part of your job. And there's a time to put up the white flag, to accept the fact that you don't have skills or time to get to a solution in the required time. You need more, but you also need to make it work.

That's when a wrong solution is fine. You comply with the request, knowing perfectly you still have a work to do, but that work cannot be accomplished so easily.

It's the MVP concept, applied to real problems.
