## there are things that last forever

One man once said to me: Nothing is more definitive than a temporary solution.

He was damn right.
Our internal narrative says "We'll cope with this temporary solution and then we'll fix it".
But we won't fix it.

I've _never_ saw a different story. The times when we decide to change a "temporary" solution are so rare that this old saying rings true.
What to do about it? Don't call it temporary, and go for the good solution.
Because, another great man said, you spend the same amount of time developing a bad and a good solution, so better go with the good one.
