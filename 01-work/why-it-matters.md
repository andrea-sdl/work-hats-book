## why it matters

Working might feel like trying to help a ship going forward with no idea on where we're going. No information on where we're heading.

It's easy and sometimes required to hide information. To share less of the task to avoid people trying to do something they're not supposed to.

This is a way to control the flow, it works under some circumstances but it has one major flow: It doesn't allow people to grow.&nbsp;
To let them grow you should allow them to make some mistakes, to learn the boundaries between "this is a topic you are competent in and you can contribute" and the "this topic is way out of your context so it's hard to produce a great contribution".

Obviously this argument suppose that you're surrounded by people who can think with their own mind, leaving ego aside and caring about the project.
If any of these attributes is missing hope is still not lost. It's all a matter of doing one small step at a time, learning and working on the attributes that are not quite there.&nbsp;

Once you have them all in place, you can proceed.&nbsp;

"Why it matters" adds a lot of value to everyone. Because people can help you, but they can also understand why you're doing something, leaving aside some personal consideration.

For example: If a mail is sent to everyone asking to do a specific thing, you might wonder: "What's the deal? Why is it so important?"

If it's not written in the email then you add your own conclusions like "well, they just want some spotlight, etc etc" and they might be wrong.

But if it's written, like "Please, if you feel this new blog post on _balblalla_ can contribute to the team or the customer you're working with, share it with them. Our goal is to help grow both our teams and customer and gain some visibility throughout this journey".

That doesn't sound so bad, isn't it?
