# Conclusions

> _When nothing will work, Work will work._ Military quote.

When you tell people that you want to write a book some of them will see it as a gigantic work, impossible to achieve.
To be honest: It's hard.

But there's one rule that always followed: discipline trumps everything.
It might take time, but give it discipline and determination and you'll always get to the finish line.

I remember when I started taking singing lesson. I never sung in my entire life and wanted to try it.
I was terrible. When today I listen to my first recordings it's a torture.

Years later, though, I remember people coming to me and telling me "wow, your good". I still wasn't great, but the difference was clear.
To get there I passed along many many moments when I was awful. When my singing was low, with wrong timing, etc etc etc.

I kept practicing and in the end I become good at it.

I did the same for many things in life and this is simply to prove that I'm not special, I'm not lucky nor I have any special talent.

The recipe is the same: discipline trumps everything.
That's what you should always keep in mind. 
Whatever the goal, whatever the problems, whatever the obstacles: Discipline can get you through.

Be well and have a great life.

## Reading List

When I started writing this small book I though _"why writing if there's so much great books on each topic?"_
Then I realized that not everyone read those books nor they are interested instantly.

But if you want to dig deeper, to go beyond the simple concepts I presented, then you deserve to read them, you should do it because you care and because it's important.

As such, here's my personal list of what I liked and that build up many of the ideas I shared.
If I should only choose one book/audiobook I'd say my personal life-changing favorite is
**"The power of vulnerability" by "Brenè Brown"**

It's an audiobook that entirely changed the way I interact with people, the way I see personal connection and how I share my struggles.
It's worth every penny.
